# "Java technology" laboratory tasks and solutions.
This repository contains implemented laboratory tasks for discipline "Java technology" of
[ZAPORIZHIA STATE ENGINEERING ACADEMY](http://www.zgia.zp.ua/index.php?page=1254&lang=ru).

### Goals and Objectives.
This repository is helpful for those students, who already have skills in Java
or for those who choose other language for development and not interested in spending time for Java.
The main idea is in that fact, that the time of developer is quite expensive. So at some point your time will cost so much $ per hour,
that you will understand that spending time (1-2 days) for completing those exercises is very stupid.
As soon as, you will know Java(or any other language) very well by that moment,
it will not be a problem for you to understand how the code of laboratory task works.
Education system in Ukraine is quite stupid, so the main idea of this repo is to help you to avoid at least some problems from huge 
list that was prepared for you by our government.

Of course if you are trying to complete this course the code also will be helpful for you as an example.
But trust no one! Im not sure are there any bugs) The only 100% fact that I can give for you, that these labs were alredy checked by the
[lecturer of this discipline](https://www.linkedin.com/in/voldymyrk/).

## Useful info

Text of tasks can be found in this [file](https://github.com/zsea-sp-labs/Java_Technology/blob/master/tasks/Java%20technology%20tasks.zip).

####LR1
implemented. Works fine
####LR2
implemented. This task is quite interesting in case if you are not familiar with KMP algorithm. Unfortunately comments are on Russian,
may be in future I will fix this.
####LR3
implemented. But this word is not completely true. I think it is more like - copypasted. How stupid can be our education system?
this task forces you just copy all methods of wraper-classes for data-types and use them at least once.
####LR4
implemented. Object-oriented programming basics, nothing interesting. There is funny fact, I had only 1part of task (you can see this in
tasks folder). Second part was created using the example that was given by one of students from my group.
####LR5
partly implemented. There is no "send file" option in chat. Also I should not be blame for this code - only a part of it is mine.
Sorry guys.

####LR6 & LR7
not implemented. At some point of development of LR5, one of students told me, that task-list for weekend college students consists
only from 4 exercises, so Dobby become free...

Good luck guys, I hope you will not waste your time.

If some one will have solutions for LR6 & LR7, please make pull-request I will add them to the repository.
